FlashCard Study is an Android app built in Android Studio to help users study with flashcards.
It displays five history-based questions one at a time on a TextView, allows users to answer true or false via buttons, 
updates a score counter, shows "Correct" or "Incorrect" feedback, and advances to the next question with a "Next" button.
